Determine how to get image intelligence docs
Send each image upstream
Get the responses
Collate them and store them in a database


Set up a basic express project
Create an endpoint for results
Create a server to send images upstream
Create a database to hold partial results

Can call and process new images as long as they are in the future?
- will all new images be in the future?
- timestamp timezones?
- detection parameters: go with defaults?

On page load dump db as JSON

On the client, open each JSON and construct the bar graph.


{
    url: pathtoimage,
    timestamp: timestamp,
    personDetected: boolean
}
